#Assignment #2


Looked at a dataset that was collected by researchers from Purdue University, Cornell University, the Environmental Defense Fund, Yale University,and Pomona 
College. The researchers recruited a racially and socioeconomically (SES) diverse online sample of 1,191 U.S. adults. The survey specified 18 different
“environmental” issues that tapped ecocentric (e.g., climate change, industrial pollution) issues reflecting physical environmental hazards and anthropocentric 
(e.g., poverty, lack of access to grocery stores) issues reflecting social determinants and consequences of environmental risk.
